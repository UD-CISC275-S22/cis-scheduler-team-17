What has been behind the recent streak of computer programs beating human world champions at all kinds of games? The AI and Robotics concentration is concerned with understanding the building blocks of cognition, as well as applying them to the development of systems that are able to perform tasks traditionally associated with human brainpower, dexterity, and/or mobility. Courses in this concentration will cover abstract notions of intelligence, including logical reasoning, knowledge representation, language, and planning; a spectrum of methods for pattern analysis and learning-by-example, including deep learning and neural networks; and skills for embodied agents, such as perception (via visual and other sensors), navigation, and interaction."[39m
