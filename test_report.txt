Data science is concerned with translating these disparate data sources into useful knowledge, through application of techniques drawn from computer science, mathematics, and statistics. The data science concentration provides the core background necessary for representing, analyzing, managing and putting these datasets to use in real-world applications. This concentration combines courses in advanced mathematics, statistics, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data mining, preparing students to make contributions in this highly interdisciplinary field."[39m

The HPC concentration delves into all aspects of these advanced computing systems, from the hardware level to the programming languages, parallel algorithms, mathematical underpinnings, and applications. The concentration also offers a choice between a data track which focuses on data analysis and statistics, and an applied mathematics track which focuses on the mathematical tools used to model real-world phenomena."[39m
