Contributing to the next operating system or Internet of everything? Improving the security of software and networks? Then the Systems and Networks concentration is for you. Through a range of courses covering operating systems, compilers, architecture, networks, and cybersecurity, students learn how modern computational systems function from the application layer all the way down to the hardware-software interface.",

Applications flow in both directions: mathematical concepts, such as formal logic, automata, and models of computation, form the theoretical foundation of computer science, while computational methods are widely used in many areas of mathematics, including linear algebra, graph theory, differential equations, algebra, theorem proving, and algorithmic analysis. The concentration offers a broad spectrum of courses in these and other subjects in mathematics and computer science. Students in the concentration have a choice between a discrete and a continuous track.",
